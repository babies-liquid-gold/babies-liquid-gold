    <p>"Low Info:

      Your milk supply is considered low when you aren't producing enough milk to meet your baby's needs. A good milk output is 25-35 ounces daily.
       
      Ways to Increase Milk Production:
      *Make sure that your baby is latching properly to your breast.
      *Feed your baby often, at least 8-12 times a day
      *Stop smoking/ drinking alcohol
      *Choose birth control that does not contain estrogen
      *Breastfeed skin to skin, it releases hormones that aid in milk production
      *Eat a healthy, well balanced diet that is rich in protein, whole grains, leafy green vegetables and legumes/beans. Some herbs such as fennel and fenugreek may increase milk production.
