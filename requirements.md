# Requirements

1. What is the vision of this product?

To create an app where users will input their breast milk production on a daily rate, be placed in a specific bracket (high, moderate, and low) and after a user click receive information to help with their production based on that bracket.

2. What pain point does this project solve?

Numerous mothers and babies struggle daily when mothers are unable to provide enough breast milk to support the Nic-U child and are forced to switch to processed suppliments. The goal is to help alleviate that bothersome transition by giving natural selection back to the mother and child.

3. Why should we care about your product?

This product is extremely important as while most can, not all babies can easily swap over to formula for nourishment, so providing families the option of a donor for breast milk would not only allow for faster recovery for infants but also provide options to those struggling.

## Scope

Provide information to user about the company as well as what our goal is. Take on user input for information, input information into the memory and return it to the provided chart of information developing a database.

This will never become a mobile app, it will only be accessible to medical facilities as a database similar to that of a blood bank.

### MVP

The minimum that this app should accomplish, take userName input store to local storage and display it on their daily tracking page. Take in user input through a form, store and maintain user input, while placing the users information inside local storage, output all stored data for daily tracking and allow the user to click an image that cooresponds to relevant information to help daily production rates.

#### Data Flow

The flow of data will be as followed, the user will be presented with a home page outlining details of the company. It will also have hyperlinks for the different pages as well as a button to output information. Page two will have an informational section comprised of the founding members of the company as well as information each member wishes to convey to the rest. Page three will house the functional part of the app itself, showcasing the user input adding information to the database.
