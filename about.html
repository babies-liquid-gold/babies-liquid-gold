    Providing our babies with human breast milk is the best choice compared to alternative options such as cows milk. Human breastmilk provides plenty of essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that aid in their growth and development so it is important that we understand how we can ensure that we provide our little ones with the right amount daily. On average, a woman produces from 570-900 ml (19.27-30.43 oz) per day. Some women have a hard time producing this amount of milk daily and increasing the number of times you pump per day or eating more fruits and veggies to promote milk production becomes necessary. Here at Babies Liquid Gold, we give you the opportunity to log your daily production allowing you to keep track of how much milk you produce per day. Logging this information allows us to offer you tips and advice on what you can do to increase your daily output, thus giving your beautiful baby the nutrients he/she needs.
